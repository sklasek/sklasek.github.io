I am a computational biologist who uses sequence data to uncover how microbes work with plants and create more sustainable agricultural solutions. 

Here's a cool photo I took in Iceland:

Hey, cool website template! How did you build it?
------
I barely did anything. I used a github template called Academic Pages that can be found [here](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). There is also a [wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and a [discussion board on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
